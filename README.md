# Introduction
A blog with django

In this repository there is the implementation in django of a blog. It was created to learn thow to use the Django framework in addition to why I would like to open a blog to talk about computer science, music and critical thinking.

---

# Setup 
1. Install [Visual studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or your favourite text editor

2. Install [git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). 

    I would recommend you to use git bash to run terminal commands.

3. Intall [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

    I would recommend you to install [3.8.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/) version.

4. If you are on MacOS I would racommend to intall pip package management system.

    ```
    $ sudo easy_install pip
    ```
---

## First step
Now, you can fork or clone this repository and in the folder you can try to set up the python development environment.

Window:
```
$ python -m venv virt
```

MacOS:
```
$ sudo pip install virtualenv
```
```
$ virtualenv thanos
```
```
$ cd thanos
```
---

## Second step
You should want to turn on your virtual environment.

Window:
```
$ source virt/Scripts/activate
```
MacOS:
```
$ source bin/activate
```

---

## Third step
Now, you have to install Django.

Window:
```
$ pip intall django==4.0.6
```
MacOS:
```
$ sudo pip install django==4.0.6
```

---

## Command for windows users
Start and setup a new django project

Maybe the command `manage.py` could be only `manage`

```
$ django-admin.py startproject --project_name--
```

```
$ cd --project_name--
```

Preps your database for migration

```
$ python manage.py makemigrations
```

Execute your migration & updates the database
```
$ python manage.py migrate
```

---

Run a server

Maybe the command `manage.py` could be only `manage`

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

And now write on your favorite browser `localhost:8000`

---

Create a user with admin level premissions

Maybe the command `manage.py` could be only `manage`

```
$ winpty python manage.py createsuperuser 
```

---

Create app folder and files

Maybe the command `manage.py` could be only `manage`

```
$ python manage.py startapp --app_name--
```

In this case the app_name is `theblog` on the firsr folder ablog

After this, you should add in INTALLED_APPS on --project_name--/--project_name--/setting.py file the line 
```python
'--name--',
```

And, you should add in urlpatterns on --project_name--/--project_name--/urls.py the line

```python
path('', include('--app_name--.urls')),
```

And add at the end of the line `from django.urls import path` the `include` modules like this: 

```python
from django.urls import path, include
```

Now, you should create a `utils.py` file on --app_name-- folder like this:
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('''...''')
]
```

---
Generate your random django secret key.

```
$ python manage.py shell
```

In the shell:

```python
$ from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
```

```python
$ print(get_random_secret_key())
```
